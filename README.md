- We'll be using a relational database for data storage, and there are many different options: SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and others. ORM, which can take Python objects and turn them into database rows.
- ORM library (SQLAlchemy) helps us with many potential issues with using SQL, such as:
  - Multi-threading support
  - Handling creating the tables and defining the rows
  - Database migrations (with help of another library, Alembic)
  - Like mentioned, it makes the code cleaner, simpler, and shorter
- What is Flask-SQLAlchemy?
  - SQLAlchemy is the ORM library, that helps map Python classes to database tables and columns, and turns Python objects of those classes into specific rows.
  - Flask-SQLAlchemy is a Flask extension which helps connect SQLAlchemy to Flask apps.
- What is Flask-Migrate:
